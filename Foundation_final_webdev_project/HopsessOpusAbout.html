	About.
</h1>
<p class = "paragraph_2">Have you ever dreamed of carrying your pet whenever you go? <br>
Or perhaps having a fantastical creature from your imagination standing on your 
bookshelf? Have you ever struggled looking for a gift for a friend who is keen on equestrian 
sports or dog training? <br> <br> Our realistic clay models will help you. <br> We pay a lot of attention to details, so 
the model is guaranteed to show character and have main features of the animal. If you have any questions, go 
to contact page and be welcome to text us! You can find all prices at out shop section.</p>

Who we are.

<p class = "paragraph_2">From my childhood I had a desire to create, especially when it came to drawing animals or crafting some tools for toys. <br><br>
After years of practicing in sculpting, drawing and actually working with animals, I have learned about muscles work, character types and anatomy in general,
 and continue to improve my skills with each model. I notice the slightest details and have imagination reach enough to be able to see the final result.<br>
 So, you can be sure that everything would be discussed and understood before the model will be made, for it to be as close to your pet or fantasy creature as possible. <br><br>
